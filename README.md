# Spotify API Project

This is my "first" time using an API in a project, at least, by myself and reading the documentation, in this case I used RapidAPI to fetch the data.

This webapp is like a song wikipedia, you search the song (it also allows artists and albums as input, but it only displays songs). The song, album art and artist are from Spotify, for now, the web has the next features:

- Displays cover art, song name and artist name.
- Lets the user look for the song in the Spotify Web or playing it directly in the Spotify app.
- Looks and "creates" a link for the song lyrics on Genius (there are some bugs here, they'll be fixed).
